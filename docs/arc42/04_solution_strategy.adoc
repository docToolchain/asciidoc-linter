== Solution Strategy

=== Quality Goals and Architectural Approaches

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Solution Approach |Details

|Extensibility
|* Abstract base classes
* Plugin architecture
* Clear interfaces
|* New rules can be added by extending base classes
* Plugin system allows external rule packages
* Well-defined interfaces for rule implementation

|Reliability
|* Comprehensive testing
* Strong typing
* Defensive programming
|* High test coverage
* Type hints throughout the code
* Careful input validation

|Usability
|* Clear error messages
* Context information
* Configuration options
|* Detailed error descriptions
* Line and column information
* Configurable rule severity

|Performance
|* Efficient algorithms
* Lazy loading
* Caching
|* Line-by-line processing
* Rules loaded on demand
* Cache parsing results

|Maintainability
|* Clean architecture
* SOLID principles
* Documentation
|* Clear separation of concerns
* Single responsibility principle
* Comprehensive documentation

=== Technology Decisions

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Technology |Decision |Rationale

|Python
|Primary implementation language
|* Strong standard library
* Great text processing capabilities
* Wide adoption in tooling

|Regular Expressions
|Pattern matching
|* Built into Python
* Efficient for text processing
* Well understood by developers

|YAML
|Configuration format
|* Human readable
* Standard format
* Good library support

|unittest
|Testing framework
|* Part of Python standard library
* Well known to developers
* Good IDE support

=== Implementation Patterns

....
@startuml
package "Core Patterns" {
  [Factory Pattern] as Factory
  [Strategy Pattern] as Strategy
  [Observer Pattern] as Observer
}

package "Implementation" {
  [Rule Factory] as RuleFactory
  [Rule Strategy] as RuleStrategy
  [Event System] as Events
}

Factory --> RuleFactory : implements
Strategy --> RuleStrategy : implements
Observer --> Events : implements

note right of RuleFactory : Creates rule instances
note right of RuleStrategy : Executes rules
note right of Events : Notifies about findings
