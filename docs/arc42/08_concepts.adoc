@startuml
package "Domain Model" {
    class Document {
        +content: str
        +path: Path
        +get_lines(): List[str]
    }
    
    class Rule {

=== Security Concepts

==== Authentication and Authorization
* Package distribution secured via PyPI authentication
* Configuration files with restricted access
* Signed releases with GPG keys

==== Input Validation
* Strict content validation
* Safe file handling
* Memory usage limits

==== Output Sanitization
* Escaped error messages
* Safe file paths handling
* Controlled error reporting

=== Development Concepts

==== Test Strategy

[plantuml]
....
@startuml
package "Test Levels" {
    [Unit Tests] as unit
    [Integration Tests] as integration
    [System Tests] as system
    [Performance Tests] as performance
}

package "Test Types" {
    [Functional Tests] as functional
    [Security Tests] as security
    [Usability Tests] as usability
}

package "Test Tools" {
    [unittest] as unittest_tool
    [pytest] as pytest
    [coverage] as coverage
}

unit --> unittest_tool
integration --> pytest
system --> pytest
performance --> pytest

unittest_tool --> coverage
pytest --> coverage

=== Configuration Concepts

==== Rule Configuration

[source,yaml]
----
rules:
  heading_hierarchy:
    enabled: true
    severity: error
    options:
      max_level: 6
      
  heading_format:
    enabled: true
    severity: warning
    options:
      require_space: true
      require_capitalization: true
----

==== Plugin System

[plantuml]
....
@startuml
package "Plugin System" {
    interface "RulePlugin" {
        +get_rules(): List[Rule]
        +get_config(): Dict
    }
    
    class "CustomRulePlugin" {
        +get_rules()
        +get_config()
    }
    
    class "PluginLoader" {
        +load_plugins()
        +get_available_rules()
    }
    
    RulePlugin <|.. CustomRulePlugin
    PluginLoader --> RulePlugin : loads
}
