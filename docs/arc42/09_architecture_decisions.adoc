== Architecture Decisions

=== ADR 1: Rule Base Class Design

==== Status
Accepted

==== Context
We need a flexible and extensible way to implement different linting rules for AsciiDoc documents.

==== Decision
We will use an abstract base class `Rule` with a defined interface that all concrete rules must implement.

==== Consequences
* *Positive*
** Consistent interface for all rules
** Easy to add new rules
** Clear separation of concerns
** Simplified testing through common interface
* *Negative*
** Additional abstraction layer
** Slight performance overhead

=== ADR 2: Finding Data Structure

==== Status
Accepted

==== Context
Rule violations need to be reported in a consistent and informative way.

==== Decision
We will use a `Finding` data class with fields for message, severity, position, rule ID, and context.

==== Consequences
* *Positive*
** Structured error reporting
** Rich context for violations
** Consistent error format
* *Negative*
** More complex than simple string messages
** Requires more memory for storing findings

=== ADR 3: Rule Implementation Strategy

==== Status
Accepted

==== Context
Rules need to process AsciiDoc content and identify violations efficiently.

==== Decision
Each rule will process the content line by line, using regular expressions for pattern matching.

==== Consequences
* *Positive*
** Simple implementation
** Good performance for most cases
** Easy to understand and maintain
* *Negative*
** Limited context awareness
** May miss some complex patterns
** Regular expressions can become complex

=== ADR 4: Test Strategy

==== Status
Accepted

==== Context
Rules need to be thoroughly tested to ensure reliable operation.

==== Decision
Each rule will have its own test class with multiple test methods covering various scenarios.

==== Consequences
* *Positive*
** High test coverage
** Clear test organization
** Easy to add new test cases
* *Negative*
** More maintenance effort
** Longer test execution time
