=== Risk Analysis

[cols="1,2,2,1,2"]
|===
|Risk |Description |Impact |Probability |Mitigation

|Performance Degradation
|Rule processing becomes slow with many rules
|High
|Medium
|* Profile rule execution
* Implement rule caching
* Optimize core algorithms

|Memory Leaks
|Long-running processes accumulate memory
|High
|Low
|* Regular memory profiling
* Automated testing
* Resource cleanup

|False Positives
|Rules report incorrect violations
|Medium
|High
|* Extensive test cases
* User feedback system
* Rule configuration options

|Plugin Conflicts
|Custom rules interfere with core rules
|Medium
|Medium
|* Plugin isolation
* Version compatibility checks
* Clear plugin API
