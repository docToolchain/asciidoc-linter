== ADR 1: Rule Base Class Design

=== Status

Accepted

=== Context

We need a flexible and extensible way to implement different linting rules for AsciiDoc documents.

=== Decision

We will use an abstract base class `Rule` with a defined interface that all concrete rules must implement.

=== Consequences

* *Positive*
** Consistent interface for all rules
** Easy to add new rules
** Clear separation of concerns
** Simplified testing through common interface
* *Negative*
** Additional abstraction layer
** Slight performance overhead
