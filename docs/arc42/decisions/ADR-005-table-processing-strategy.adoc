== ADR 5: Table Processing Strategy

=== Status

Proposed

=== Context

Table processing in AsciiDoc documents requires complex parsing and validation:
* Tables can contain various content types (text, lists, blocks) * Cell extraction needs to handle multi-line content * Column counting must be reliable * List detection in cells must be accurate

Current implementation has issues:
* Cell extraction produces incorrect results * List detection generates false positives * Column counting is unreliable

=== Decision

We will implement a new table processing strategy:

1. *Two-Pass Parsing*
* First pass: Identify table boundaries and structure
* Second pass: Extract and validate cell content

2. *Cell Content Model*
* Create a dedicated TableCell class
* Track content type (text, list, block)
* Maintain line number information

3. *List Detection*
* Use state machine for list recognition
* Track list context across cell boundaries
* Validate list markers against AsciiDoc spec

4. *Column Management*
* Count columns based on header row
* Validate all rows against header
* Handle empty cells explicitly

=== Technical Details

[source,python]
----
class TableCell:
    def __init__(self):
        self.content = []
        self.content_type = None
        self.start_line = None
        self.end_line = None
        self.has_list = False
        self.list_level = 0

class TableRow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cells = []
        self.line_number = None
        self.is_header = False

class TableProcessor:
    def first_pass(self, lines):
        # Identify table structure
        pass

    def second_pass(self, table_lines):
        # Extract cell content
        pass

    def detect_lists(self, cell):
        # Use state machine for list detection
        pass

=== Consequences

* *Positive*
** More accurate cell extraction
** Reliable list detection
** Better error reporting
** Maintainable code structure
** Clear separation of concerns

* *Negative*
** More complex implementation
** Slightly higher memory usage
** Additional processing overhead
** More code to maintain

=== Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: Core Structure
* Implement TableCell and TableRow classes
* Basic two-pass parsing
* Unit tests for basic functionality

2. Phase 2: Content Processing
* List detection state machine
* Content type recognition
* Error context collection

3. Phase 3: Validation
* Column counting
* Structure validation
* Comprehensive test suite

=== Validation

Success criteria:
* All current table-related tests pass * Cell extraction matches expected results * List detection has no false positives * Column counting is accurate * Memory usage remains within limits
