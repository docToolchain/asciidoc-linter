== ADR 6: Severity Standardization

=== Status

Proposed

=== Context

Current implementation has inconsistent severity level handling:
* Mixed case usage (ERROR vs error) * Inconsistent severity levels across rules * No clear guidelines for severity assignment

=== Decision

We will standardize severity handling:

1. *Severity Levels*
* ERROR: Issues that must be fixed
* WARNING: Issues that should be reviewed
* INFO: Suggestions for improvement

2. *Implementation*
* Use lowercase for internal representation
* Provide case-sensitive display methods
* Add severity level documentation

3. *Migration*
* Update all existing rules
* Add validation in base class
* Update tests to use new standard

=== Consequences

* *Positive*
** Consistent severity handling
** Clear guidelines for new rules
** Better user experience
* *Negative*
** Need to update existing code
** Potential backward compatibility issues
