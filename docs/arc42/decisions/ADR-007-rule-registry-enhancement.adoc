== ADR 7: Rule Registry Enhancement

=== Status

Proposed

=== Context

Current rule registry implementation lacks:
* Test coverage * Clear registration mechanism * Version handling * Rule dependency management

=== Decision

We will enhance the rule registry:

1. *Registration*
* Add explicit registration decorator
* Support rule dependencies
* Add version information

2. *Management*
* Add rule enabling/disabling
* Support rule groups
* Add configuration validation

3. *Testing*
* Add comprehensive test suite
* Test all registration scenarios
* Test configuration handling

=== Consequences

* *Positive*
** Better rule management
** Clear registration process
** Improved testability
* *Negative*
** More complex implementation
** Additional maintenance overhead
