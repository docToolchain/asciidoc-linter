== BLOCK001: Unterminated Block Check

=== Purpose

This rule checks for blocks in AsciiDoc files that are not properly terminated.
It helps prevent incomplete or malformed block structures that could lead to incorrect rendering.

=== Severity

ERROR

=== Supported Block Types

* Listing blocks (`----`)
* Example blocks (`====`)
* Sidebar blocks (`****`)
* Literal blocks (`....`)
* Quote blocks (`____`)
* Table blocks (`|===`)
* Comment blocks (`////`)
* Passthrough blocks (`++++`)

=== Examples

==== Valid Block Structure

[source,asciidoc]
----
.Example Title
====
This is an example block.
It has proper opening and closing delimiters.
====
----

==== Invalid Block Structure

[source,asciidoc]
----
.Example Title
====
This block is not properly terminated.
More content...
----

=== Error Messages

* "Unterminated listing block starting"
* "Unterminated example block starting"
* "Unterminated sidebar block starting"
* (similar messages for other block types)

== BLOCK002: Block Spacing Check

=== Purpose

This rule ensures proper spacing around blocks by checking for blank lines before and after block structures.
Proper spacing improves readability and follows AsciiDoc best practices.

=== Severity

WARNING

=== Rules

1. A blank line should precede a block (except when it follows a heading)
2. A blank line should follow a block (except when it's followed by a heading)

=== Examples

==== Valid Block Spacing

[source,asciidoc]
----
Some text before the block.

----

Block content

----

More text after the block.
----

==== Invalid Block Spacing

[source,asciidoc]
----
Some text before the block.
----

Block content

----
More text after the block.
----

=== Error Messages

* "Block should be preceded by a blank line"
* "Block should be followed by a blank line"

=== Special Cases

* Blocks immediately following headings don't require a preceding blank line
* Blocks immediately followed by headings don't require a following blank line

== Implementation Details

=== Rule Classes

* `UnterminatedBlockRule`: Implements BLOCK001
* `BlockSpacingRule`: Implements BLOCK002

=== Configuration

Currently, these rules are not configurable.
Future versions may allow:

* Custom block types
* Adjustable severity levels
* Exceptions for specific block types
* Custom spacing requirements

=== Performance Considerations

* Both rules process files line by line
* Block tracking uses minimal memory
* Processing time is O(n) where n is the number of lines
