a| 
*Value Proposition*

* Automated quality assurance for AsciiDoc documentation
* Consistent documentation style across projects
* Early detection of documentation issues
* Reduced review effort
* Integration with CI/CD pipelines

.2+a| *Core Functions*

* Lint AsciiDoc files for common issues
* Check heading structure and format
* Validate document consistency
* Generate detailed reports
* Configurable rule sets
* Multiple output formats (console, JSON, HTML)
* Git pre-commit hook integration

.3+a| *Core Decisions - Good or Bad*

Good:

* Python as implementation language (wide adoption, great libraries)
* Modular rule system for easy extension
* Clear separation of concerns (rules, parser, reporter)
* Test-driven development approach
* AsciiDoc for documentation

Bad:

* Limited to AsciiDoc format
* No real-time linting
* No IDE integration yet

Strategic:

* Focus on documentation quality
* Extensible architecture
* Community-driven rule development

.3+a| *Technologies*

* Python 3.8+
* unittest framework
* AsciiDoc parser
* YAML/JSON for configuration
* Git integration
* CI/CD tools
* HTML report generation

.2+a| *Key Stakeholder*

* Documentation writers
* Technical authors
* Development teams
* Documentation maintainers
* Open source projects
* Technical documentation teams
* Quality assurance teams

a| *Quality Requirements*

* Performance: Fast processing for CI/CD
* Extensibility: Easy to add new rules
* Reliability: No false positives
* Usability: Clear error messages
* Configurability: Flexible rule settings
* Maintainability: Well-documented code
* Testability: Comprehensive test suite

2+a| *Business Context*

External Systems:

* Version Control Systems (Git)
* CI/CD Pipelines
* Documentation Build Tools
* IDE Plugins (planned)
* Issue Tracking Systems

Data Flow:

* AsciiDoc files as input
* Configuration files (YAML/JSON)
* Lint reports as output
* Integration webhooks

2+a| *Components / Modules*

[plantuml]
....
package "AsciiDoc Linter" {
  [CLI] as cli
  [Config Parser] as config
  [Document Parser] as parser
  [Rule Engine] as engine
  [Reporter] as reporter
  
  package "Rules" {
    [Heading Rules]
    [Block Rules]
    [Format Rules]
  }
  
  package "Reporters" {
    [Console Reporter]
    [JSON Reporter]
    [HTML Reporter]
  }
}
....

4+a| *Core Risks and Missing Information*

Risks:

* Performance impact on large documentation sets
* False positives affecting user acceptance
* Complexity of rule configurations
* Integration challenges with existing tools
* Maintenance of rule set as AsciiDoc evolves

Missing Information:

* Real-world usage patterns
* Common documentation anti-patterns
* IDE integration requirements
* Performance benchmarks
* User preferences for rule configuration
