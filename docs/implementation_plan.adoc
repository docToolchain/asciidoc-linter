== Current Status Analysis

=== Test Infrastructure Status (Updated December 2024)
* ✅ Coverage Tools working
** Coverage report generation fixed
** HTML reports generating correctly
** Source code detection working
* ✅ Test Infrastructure working
** 130 tests implemented
** 122 tests passing (94%)
** 8 tests failing
* ✅ Overall test coverage at 95%
** 685 statements total
** 36 statements not covered
** Most modules >90% coverage

=== Module Coverage Status

==== Perfect Coverage (100%)
* ✅ image_rules.py
* ✅ parser.py
* ✅ __init__.py files

==== Very Good Coverage (95-99%)
* ✅ whitespace_rules.py (98%)
* ✅ cli.py (98%)
* ✅ base.py (97%)
* ✅ linter.py (97%)
* ✅ table_rules.py (95%)

==== Good Coverage (85-94%)
* ⚠️ block_rules.py (89%)
* ⚠️ heading_rules.py (93%)
* ⚠️ reporter.py (85%)

==== Critical Coverage Issues
* ❌ rules.py (0%)

=== Failed Tests Analysis

==== Core Architecture Issues
* ❌ Severity Implementation
** Inconsistent case handling (ERROR vs error)
** 3 failing tests in different test files
* ❌ Rule Base Class
** Missing rule_id attribute
** Default value should be "BASE"

==== Table Processing Issues
* ❌ Cell Extraction
** extract_cells returns wrong number of cells
** 2 failing tests
* ❌ Column Counting
** count_columns returns wrong value for table markers
** 1 failing test
* ❌ List Detection
** Multiple findings for single list issue
** 2 failing tests

== Updated Implementation Plan

=== Phase 1: Fix Failed Tests (2-3 days)

==== Step 1: Core Architecture Fixes (Priority: High)
* Fix Severity implementation:
** Standardize on lowercase values
** Update all rule implementations
** Fix affected tests
* Fix Rule base class:
** Add default rule_id
** Update rule_id property
* Implementation tasks:
** Update base.py
** Fix test_base.py
** Fix test_base_rules.py

==== Step 2: Table Processing Fixes (Priority: High)
* Fix cell extraction:
** Review cell parsing logic
** Fix prefix handling
** Update tests
* Fix column counting:
** Review table marker handling
** Update counting logic
* Fix list detection:
** Review finding generation
** Update validation logic
* Implementation tasks:
** Update table_rules.py
** Fix all table-related tests

=== Phase 2: Coverage Improvements (2-3 days)

==== Step 1: Critical Coverage (Priority: High)
* Fix rules.py coverage:
** Add missing tests
** Review implementation
* Implementation tasks:
** Add test_rules.py
** Update rules.py if needed

==== Step 2: Good Coverage Improvements (Priority: Medium)
* Improve block_rules.py coverage:
** Add tests for lines 26, 66, 68, 74, 92, 138, 140, 146
* Improve heading_rules.py coverage:
** Add tests for lines 25, 65, 90, 108, 145, 153
* Improve reporter.py coverage:
** Add tests for lines 51-59

=== Phase 3: Quality Improvements (2-3 days)

==== Step 1: Code Quality (Priority: Medium)
* Add type hints to all modules
* Improve error messages
* Add debug logging
* Implementation tasks:
** Add mypy configuration
** Update error handling
** Add logging framework

==== Step 2: Documentation (Priority: Medium)
* Update all documentation
* Add troubleshooting guide
* Add development guide
* Implementation tasks:
** Review all .adoc files
** Update examples
** Add migration guides

== Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. Fix Severity implementation
2. Fix Rule base class
3. Fix table processing
4. Add tests for rules.py
5. Improve coverage of other modules

== Success Criteria

* All tests passing
* Coverage >95% for all modules
* Documentation up-to-date
* Code quality improved

== Quality Gates

=== For Test Coverage
* No module with <85% coverage
* Core modules >95% coverage
* Overall project coverage >95%

=== For Code Quality
* All public methods documented
* Type hints in all modules
* Consistent error handling

== Notes

* Priority on fixing failed tests
* Coverage generally good except for rules.py
* Table processing needs significant work
* Consider adding performance tests
