== Current Status Analysis (Updated December 2023)

=== Test Status
All tests are currently passing, including:

* Heading Rules Tests
** Hierarchy checking
** Format validation
** Multiple top-level detection

* Block Rules Tests
** Unterminated block detection
** Block spacing validation

* Image Rules Tests
** Attribute validation
** File reference checking
** Alt text verification

* Table Rules Tests
** Content validation
** Format checking
** Structure verification

* Whitespace Rules Tests
** Line spacing
** List marker formatting
** Tab detection

=== Test Coverage Status
Test coverage tools (coverage.py and pytest-html) need attention:

* coverage report command not working properly
* HTML test report generation failing
* Need to fix configuration for both tools

== Implementation Plan

=== Phase 1: Tool Infrastructure (1-2 days)

==== Step 1: Test Coverage Tools (Priority: High)
* Fix coverage.py integration
** Update configuration
** Ensure proper source code detection
** Fix report generation

==== Step 2: Test Reporting (Priority: High)
* Fix HTML test report generation
** Update pytest configuration
** Fix command line arguments handling
** Add proper output directory handling

=== Phase 2: New Features (3-4 days)

==== Step 1: Table Validation Enhancement (Priority: High)
* Add new table rules:
** Cell content formatting validation
** Complex content structure checking
** Table caption validation
* Implementation tasks:
** Create new TableContentFormatRule
** Add tests for complex table structures
** Update documentation

==== Step 2: Link Checking (Priority: Medium)
* Implement link validation:
** Internal cross-reference checking
** External URL validation
** Anchor existence verification
* Implementation tasks:
** Create LinkValidationRule class
** Add URL checking functionality
** Add tests for various link types

=== Phase 3: Integration Features (4-5 days)

==== Step 1: VS Code Extension (Priority: Medium)
* Create basic VS Code extension
** Real-time linting
** Problem highlighting
** Quick fixes for common issues
* Implementation tasks:
** Set up extension project
** Implement language server protocol
** Add configuration options

==== Step 2: Git Integration (Priority: Low)
* Add Git hooks support:
** Pre-commit hook implementation
** Configuration options
** Documentation
* Implementation tasks:
** Create hook scripts
** Add configuration handling
** Write installation guide

== Next Steps

1. Fix test coverage tools
2. Implement enhanced table validation
3. Add link checking functionality
4. Start VS Code extension development

== Success Criteria

* All test tools working properly
* Test coverage >90% for all modules
* Documentation up to date
* New features fully tested
* IDE integration working reliably

== Notes

* All previously reported test failures have been fixed
* ImageAttributesRule and TableContentRule are now working correctly
* Focus should be on new features and tool infrastructure
* Consider adding performance benchmarks for large documents
