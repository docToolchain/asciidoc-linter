== Current Status Analysis

=== Test Infrastructure Status (Updated December 2024)
* ✅ Coverage Tools working
** Coverage report generation fixed
** HTML reports generating correctly
** Source code detection working
* ✅ Test Infrastructure working
** 130 tests implemented
** 122 tests passing (94%)
** 8 failures in latest run
* ✅ Overall test coverage at 95%
** 685 statements total
** 36 statements not covered
** Most modules >90% coverage

=== Module Coverage Status

==== Perfect Coverage (100%)
* ✅ image_rules.py
* ✅ parser.py
* ✅ __init__.py files

==== Very Good Coverage (95-99%)
* ✅ whitespace_rules.py (98%)
* ✅ cli.py (98%)
* ✅ base.py (97%)
* ✅ linter.py (97%)
* ✅ table_rules.py (95%)

==== Good Coverage (85-94%)
* ⚠️ block_rules.py (89%)
* ⚠️ heading_rules.py (93%)
* ⚠️ reporter.py (85%)

==== Critical Coverage Issues
* ❌ rules.py (0%)

=== Failed Tests Analysis

==== Core Architecture Issues
* ❌ Severity Implementation
** Inconsistent case handling (ERROR vs error)
** 3 failing tests
* ❌ Rule Base Class
** Missing rule_id attribute
** 1 failing test

==== Table Processing Issues
* ❌ Table Content Rule
** Cell extraction not working correctly
** List detection issues
** 3 failing tests
* ❌ Table Structure Rule
** Column counting issues
** 1 failing test

== Updated Implementation Plan

=== Phase 1: Fix Failed Tests (2-3 days)

==== Step 1: Core Architecture Fixes (Priority: High)
* Fix Severity implementation:
** Standardize on lowercase values
** Update all rule implementations
** Fix affected tests
* Fix Rule base class:
** Add default rule_id
** Update rule_id handling
* Implementation tasks:
** Update base.py
** Fix test_base.py
** Update all rule implementations

==== Step 2: Table Processing Fixes (Priority: High)
* Fix cell extraction:
** Review and fix cell counting
** Fix list detection
** Add comprehensive tests
* Fix column counting:
** Review column detection logic
** Fix empty table handling
* Implementation tasks:
** Update table_rules.py
** Fix all table-related tests

=== Phase 2: Coverage Improvements (2-3 days)

==== Step 1: Critical Coverage (Priority: High)
* Fix rules.py coverage:
** Add missing tests
** Review and update implementation
* Implementation tasks:
** Create test_rules.py
** Update rules.py implementation

==== Step 2: Module Coverage (Priority: Medium)
* Improve reporter.py coverage:
** Add tests for error handling
** Cover edge cases
* Improve block_rules.py coverage:
** Add tests for missing cases
** Review implementation
* Implementation tasks:
** Update test files
** Add edge case tests

=== Phase 3: Quality Improvements (2-3 days)

==== Step 1: Code Quality (Priority: Medium)
* Add type hints:
** Focus on public interfaces
** Add mypy configuration
* Improve error messages:
** Standardize message format
** Add context information
* Implementation tasks:
** Add type hints
** Update error handling

==== Step 2: Documentation (Priority: Medium)
* Update documentation:
** Review and update README
** Update rule documentation
** Add troubleshooting guide
* Implementation tasks:
** Update .adoc files
** Add examples

== Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. Fix Severity implementation
2. Fix Rule base class (rule_id)
3. Fix table cell extraction
4. Fix table column counting
5. Add tests for rules.py

== Success Criteria

* All tests passing
* Coverage >95% for all modules
* Documentation up-to-date
* Type hints added
* Error messages improved

== Quality Gates

=== For Test Coverage
* No module below 90% coverage
* Core modules must have >95% coverage
* All public methods must have tests

=== For Implementation
* All tests must pass
* Type hints for public interfaces
* Documentation must be current

== Notes

* Priority on fixing failed tests
* Coverage generally good except for rules.py
* Table processing needs significant work
* Consider adding performance tests
