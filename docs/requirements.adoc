== Introduction

This document describes the requirements for the AsciiDoc Linter, focusing on the rules that should be implemented to check AsciiDoc documents for common issues and style violations.

== Linting Rules

|WS001
|Check for consistent blank lines around elements
|Medium

|WS002

== Rule Categories

The rules are organized into the following categories:

* Structure Rules: Focus on document structure and organization
* Block Rules: Handle AsciiDoc block elements
* Table Rules: Specific to table formatting and content
* Image Rules: Deal with image-related issues
* Format Rules: Cover general formatting concerns
* Link Rules: Handle references and links
* Whitespace Rules: Focus on spacing and layout

== Implementation Priorities

=== Phase 1 - Core Rules
* Heading hierarchy (HEAD001, HEAD002)
* Block termination (BLOCK001)
* Basic formatting (FMT001)
* Image alt text (IMG001)

=== Phase 2 - Enhancement Rules
* Table validation (TABLE001, TABLE002, TABLE003)
* Whitespace rules (WS001, WS002)
* Link validation (LINK001)

=== Phase 3 - Polish Rules
* Remaining format rules
* External link validation
* Advanced whitespace rules

== Configuration

Each rule should be:

* Individually configurable (can be enabled/disabled)
* Severity level adjustable (error/warning/info)
* Customizable through configuration files

== Output Formats

The linter must support the following output formats:

* Console output (human-readable)
* JSON (machine-readable)
* HTML (report format)

== Future Considerations

* IDE integration
* Git pre-commit hook support
* Custom rule development
* Rule documentation generator
