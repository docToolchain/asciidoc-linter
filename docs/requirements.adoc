== Introduction

This document describes the requirements for the AsciiDoc Linter, focusing on the rules that should be implemented to check AsciiDoc documents for common issues and style violations.

|âœ… Implemented

|HEAD002
|Verify heading format (spacing and capitalization)
|âœ… Implemented

|HEAD003
|Detect multiple top-level headers in a single document
|âœ… Implemented

== Planned Rules

=== Table Rules

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
|Rule ID |Description |Priority

|TABLE001

|TABLE003
|Validate table structure (column count consistency)
|High
|===

=== Format Rules

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
|Rule ID |Description |Priority

|FMT001
|Detect Markdown-compatible styles that should be AsciiDoc syntax
|Medium

|FMT002
|Check for consistent list marker usage
|Low

|FMT003

|Medium
|===

=== Link Rules

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
|Rule ID |Description |Priority

|LINK001
|Check for broken internal references
|High

|LINK002
|Verify external link validity
|Medium
|===

== Rule Categories

The rules are organized into the following categories:

* Heading Rules: Document structure and hierarchy
* Block Rules: AsciiDoc block elements
* Whitespace Rules: Spacing and layout
* Image Rules: Image attributes and references
* Table Rules (planned): Table formatting and content
* Format Rules (planned): General formatting concerns
* Link Rules (planned): References and links

== Implementation Phases

=== Phase 1 - Core Rules (Completed)

* âœ… Heading hierarchy and format (HEAD001, HEAD002, HEAD003)
* âœ… Block termination and spacing (BLOCK001, BLOCK002)
* âœ… Whitespace rules (WS001)
* âœ… Image validation (IMG001)

=== Phase 2 - Enhancement Rules (Current)

* ðŸ”² Table validation (TABLE001, TABLE002, TABLE003)
* ðŸ”² Format rules (FMT001, FMT002, FMT003)
* ðŸ”² Link validation (LINK001, LINK002)

=== Phase 3 - Polish Rules (Planned)

* ðŸ”² IDE integration
* ðŸ”² Git pre-commit hooks
* ðŸ”² Custom rule development
* ðŸ”² Rule documentation generator

== Configuration

Each rule should be:

* Individually configurable (can be enabled/disabled)
* Severity level adjustable (error/warning/info)
* Customizable through configuration files

== Output Formats

The linter supports the following output formats:

* Console output (human-readable)
* JSON (machine-readable)
* HTML (report format)

== Future Considerations

=== Technical Enhancements

* Performance optimization for large documents
* Parallel processing for multiple files
* Incremental checking for changed files only

=== Integration Features

* IDE plugins (VS Code, IntelliJ)
* CI/CD pipeline integration
* Pre-commit hook templates

=== Rule Development

* Rule development guide
* Custom rule API
* Rule testing framework
