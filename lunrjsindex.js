Part of the docToolchain project. About AsciiDoc Linter is a command-line tool that checks your AsciiDoc files for common issues and style violations. It helps maintain consistent documentation by enforcing rules for heading structure, formatting, whitespace, and image usage. This project is part of docToolchain ( https://doctoolchain.org ), a collection of documentation tools and best practices. Features Implemented Rules Rule ID Description Severity HEAD001 Check for proper heading hierarchy (no skipping levels) ERROR HEAD002 Verify heading format (spacing and capitalization) ERROR/WARNING HEAD003 Detect multiple top-level headers ERROR BLOCK001 Check for unterminated blocks (listing, example, sidebar, etc.) ERROR BLOCK002 Verify proper spacing around blocks WARNING WS001 Check whitespace usage (blank lines, list markers, tabs) WARNING IMG001 Verify image attributes and file references WARNING/ERROR Planned Rules TABLE001: Table formatting consistency LINK001: Broken internal references FMT001: Markdown-compatible styles detection Installation # Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/docToolchain/asciidoc-linter.git # Navigate to the project directory cd asciidoc-linter # Install the package pip install .

Consequences Positive Structured error reporting Rich context for violations Consistent error format Negative More complex than simple string messages Requires more memory for storing findings ADR 3: Rule Implementation Strategy Status Accepted Context Rules need to process AsciiDoc content and identify violations efficiently. Decision Each rule will process the content line by line, using regular expressions for pattern matching. Consequences Positive Simple implementation Good performance for most cases Easy to understand and maintain Negative Limited context awareness May miss some complex patterns Regular expressions can become complex ADR 4: Test Strategy Status Accepted Context Rules need to be thoroughly tested to ensure reliable operation.

Description This rule checks that heading levels are not skipped. For example, you cannot go from a level 1 heading (=) directly to a level 3 heading (===) without having a level 2 heading (==) in between. Examples Valid Heading Hierarchy == Document Title (Level 1) === Section (Level 2) ==== Subsection (Level 3) === Another Section (Level 2) Invalid Heading Hierarchy == Document Title (Level 1) ==== Subsection (Level 3) // Error: Skipped Level 2 HEAD002: Heading Format Ensures proper heading format (spacing and capitalization). Description This rule checks two aspects of heading format: 1. There must be a space after the = characters 2. The heading text should start with an uppercase letter Examples Valid Heading Format == Document Title === Section Title ==== Subsection Title Invalid Heading Format =Document Title // Error: No space after = === section title // Warning: Starts with lowercase HEAD003: Multiple Top Level Headings Ensures document has only one top-level heading. Description This rule checks that there is only one level 1 heading (=) in the document. Multiple top-level headings can indicate structural problems or accidentally split documents. Examples Valid Single Top Level == Main Document Title === Section One === Section Two Invalid Multiple Top Level == First Title === Section One == Second Title // Error: Multiple top-level headings Block Rules BLOCK001: Unterminated Blocks Checks for blocks that are not properly terminated. Description This rule ensures that all block delimiters are properly paired. Each opening delimiter must have a matching closing delimiter. Supported Block Types Listing blocks (----) Example blocks (====) Sidebar blocks ( * *) Literal blocks (&#8230;&#8203;.) Quote blocks ( __ ) Table blocks (|===) Comment blocks (////) Passthrough blocks (). Examples Valid Block Termination [source,python] def hello(): print(\"Hello, World!\") .Example Block ==== Some example content ==== Invalid Block Termination [source,python] def hello(): print(\"Hello, World!\") Example 1. Example Block Some example content ==== BLOCK002: Block Spacing Verifies proper spacing around blocks. ===== Description This rule checks that blocks are properly separated from surrounding content with blank lines, improving readability. ===== Examples .Valid Block Spacing [source,asciidoc] Some text before the block. Block content Some text after the block. .Invalid Block Spacing [source,asciidoc] Some text before the block. ---- // Warning: No blank line before block Block content Some text after the block. // Warning: No blank line after block === Whitespace Rules ==== WS001: Whitespace Usage Ensures proper whitespace usage throughout the document. ===== Checks Performed Consecutive Empty Lines : No more than one consecutive empty line List Marker Spacing : Proper space after list markers (*, -, .) Admonition Block Spacing : Blank line before admonition blocks Trailing Whitespace : No trailing spaces at end of lines Tab Usage : No tabs (use spaces instead) Section Title Spacing : Blank lines around section titles ===== Examples Valid Whitespace Usage == Document Title === Section Title * List item 1 * List item 2 NOTE: This is a note. Some text here. Invalid Whitespace Usage == Document Title === Section Title // Missing blank line before *Invalid list item // Missing space after marker NOTE: Invalid note // Missing blank line before Some text here // Trailing spaces Tabbed line // Tab instead of spaces Extra blank line // Too many blank lines === Image Rules ==== IMG001: Image Attributes Verifies image attributes and file references. ===== Description This rule checks: 1. All images have alt text 2. Referenced local images exist 3. Block images have titles 4. Image attributes are properly formatted ===== Examples Valid Image Usage // Inline image with alt text image:icon.png[Icon] // Block image with title and alt text .Figure 1: System Architecture image::diagram.png[Architecture Diagram] // External image with alt text image:https://example.com/img.png[Example Image] Invalid Image Usage // Missing alt text image:icon.png[] // Missing title for block image image::diagram.png[Diagram] // Non-existent local file image::missing.png[Missing Image] === Planned Rules ==== TABLE001: Table Formatting (Planned) Will check table formatting consistency: * Column alignment * Header row presence * Cell content formatting ==== LINK001: Link Verification (Planned) Will verify: * Internal cross-references * External link validity * Anchor definitions ==== FMT001: Format Consistency (Planned) Will check: * Consistent emphasis style * List formatting * Admonition usage "
